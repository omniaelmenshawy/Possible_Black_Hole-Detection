# Possible_Black_Hole-Detection
After A star's death, it could dissapear in the huge space, form a neutron star, make a supernova, or form a black hole.
It all dependes on some physical features that a star may have. 
I added some features such as the Tempreature, Luminousity, Coldness, and radius to detect if there are possible Black holes formation in the far future or not.
