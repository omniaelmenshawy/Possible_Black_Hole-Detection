# Possible_Black_Hole-Detection
After A star's death,it could dissapear in the huge space, form a neutron star, make a supernova, or form a black hole.,
it all dependes on some physical features that a star may have.  I added some features such as the Tempreature, Luminousity, Coldness, and radius to detect if there are possible Black holes formation in the far future or not.
